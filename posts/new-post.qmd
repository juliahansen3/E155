I am excited to take MicroPs this Fall and learn more about FPGAs and embedded systems! My goals 
for the semester are to grow in confidence in my technical and professional skills, especially when
presenting my work and to plan ahead each lab and the final project in order to maximize learning
and avoid stress.
